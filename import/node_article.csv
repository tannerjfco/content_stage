Negative <a class=""extiw"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ambient_gravity"" title=""w:ambient gravity"">ambient gravity</a> near the equator of the asteroid (48±24% of its surface) requires existence of <a class=""extiw"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cohesive_forces"" title=""w:cohesive forces"">cohesive forces</a> to prevent loss of material. This is similar to an effect noticed between the fine <a class=""extiw"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain_size"" title=""w:Grain size"">grains</a> of <a class=""extiw"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regolith"" title=""w:regolith"">regolith</a> on the <a class=""extiw"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon"" title=""w:Moon"">Moon</a>.

It's exciting because we've provided the first evidence that cohesive forces are important for small asteroids, which had only been predicted up until now.""</p> <p>The balance between <a class=""extiw"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_%28geology%29"" title=""w:Cohesion (geology)"">cohesion</a> and <a class=""extiw"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/negative_gravity"" title=""w:negative gravity"">negative gravity</a> requires small grain sizes consistent with the grain size distribution on 1950DA, and similar to that of another rubble-pile asteroid, <a class=""extiw"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%2825143%29_Itokawa"" title=""w:(25143) Itokawa"">(25143) Itokawa</a>. Unlike Itokawa, 1950DA does not have large <a class=""extiw"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boulder"" title=""w:boulder"">boulder</a>s on the surface; they may have been lost as 1950DA's rotation accelerated due to <a class=""extiw"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YORP_effect"" title=""w:YORP effect"">YORP effect</a>. This effect results in a change of the rotation rate of an asteroid (either faster or slower), and is caused when the <a class=""extiw"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun"" title=""w:Sun"">Sun</a> heats up an object unevenly, due to asymmetric surface <a class=""extiw"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/topography"" title=""w:topography"">topography</a>. As the heat escapes, the rotation rate is slowly changed due to an uneven rate of cooling. The researchers find that a rubble-pile asteroid may have a high rotation rate, if it is held together by cohesive forces between the grains. But as the spin rate increases due to YORP effect, the centrifugal force may cause the rubble pile to eventually separate as it happened with <a class=""extiw"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main-belt_comet#P.2F2013_R3"" title=""w:Main-belt comet"">P/2013 R3</a>.</p> <p>The findings may have implications for <a class=""extiw"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asteroid_impact_avoidance"" title=""w:asteroid impact avoidance"">asteroid impact avoidance</a>. A very small impulse may break one <a class=""extiw"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/potentially_hazardous_object"" title=""w:potentially hazardous object"">potentially hazardous object</a> into several pieces. As Ben Rozitis said: ""You'd want to avoid interacting with the asteroid directly. An alternative is to use a 'gravity tractor,' or a heavy spacecraft placed near the asteroid, which uses the force of gravity to pull the asteroid off course"". Bong Wie, an <a class=""extiw"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aerospace_engineer"" title=""w:aerospace engineer"">aerospace engineer</a> at <a class=""extiw"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_State_University"" title=""w:Iowa State University"">Iowa State University</a> in <a class=""extiw"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ames"" title=""w:Ames"">Ames</a>, noted: ""I just hope that an asteroid on a collision course with Earth will not be spinning rapidly and it will not be a rubble-pile asteroid"".</p> <p>According to Daniel Scheeres, an <a class=""extiw"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aerospace_engineer"" title=""w:aerospace engineer"">aerospace engineer</a> at the <a class=""extiw"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Colorado"" title=""w:University of Colorado"">University of Colorado</a>, <a class=""extiw"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder"" title=""w:Boulder"">Boulder</a>, understanding such cohesive forces may also be important for future <a class=""extiw"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asteroid_mining"" title=""w:asteroid mining"">asteroid mining</a>. Ben Rozitis clarified: ""Mining missions intend to visit small asteroids about 10 meters (33 feet) or less in size, as it is thought that they are predominantly solid bodies. However, cohesive forces enable such small asteroids to be rubble piles instead. A small rubble-pile asteroid would be harder to interact with and collect, as it can easily deform or break up when subject to external forces.""</p> <p>The study was supported by <a class=""extiw"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory"" title=""w:Jet Propulsion Laboratory"">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a>, <a class=""extiw"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology"" title=""w:California Institute of Technology"">California Institute of Technology</a> and the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/NASA"" title=""NASA"">NASA</a>.</p><p><a href=""http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/US_researchers_find_a_large_asteroid_held_together_by_forces_other_than_gravity?dpl_id=1530921"">Original Source: Wikinews</a></p><p><a href=""http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/"">Content license Creative Commons CC BY 2.5</a></p>"

According to the study, that is an estimated 24,000 children annually.

The study also documents the other ways children are commonly injured including collisions, cart tip overs, and trapped limbs.

The more AP2-G, the higher the rate of gametocyte formation. Researchers in England, later also drawn into the international team, analyzed the <a class=""extiw"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genome"" title=""w:genome"">genomes</a> of two mutated strains of <em>P. falciparum</em> which were both unable to form gametocytes. They found that the gene responsible for producing the AP2-G protein was the only common non-functioning gene.</p> <p>The international team found found the AP2-G protein catalyzes the transmission by activating a relevant gene set in the parasite.</p> <p>Both teams confirmed the finding by <a class=""extiw"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gene_therapy"" title=""w:gene therapy"">gene therapy</a> — both by adding the gene into a mutated strain and observing its ability to form gametocytes, and the other way round.</p> <p>The parasites exist in a mosquito, then in a human, and require subsequent transmission for the parasite to spread. The transmission can only happen through gametocytes. The parasite triggers formation of the sexual gametocytes into the human's circulatory system every two days in small quantities — not wasting energy on the process at the dry time of year when few mosquitoes are available — but little was known about the mechanism.</p> <p>Dr. Oliver Billker commented on the potential of getting the transmission of malaria under control, unlike the existing focus on addressing the phrase causing the clinical symptoms, ""Current drugs treat patients by killing the sexless form of the parasite in their blood — this is the detrimental stage of the malaria lifecycle that causes illness. However, it is now widely accepted that to eliminate malaria from an entire region, it will be equally important to kill the sexual forms that transmit the disease.""</p> <p>The researchers hope to continue research toward drugs to prevent the transmission of the disease.
